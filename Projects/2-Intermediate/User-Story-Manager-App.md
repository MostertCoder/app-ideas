# User Stories Manager

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

User stories are one of the most important aspects of the planning phase in almost all software projects. We use
them even when just describing an app idea (as you can see in this repo).

According to Wikipedia: "a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features
of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. They
are often recorded on index cards, on Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software.
Depending on the project, user stories may be written by various stakeholders including clients, users,
managers, or development team members."

The purpose of this application would be to develop a simple and efficient method for creating, storing
and managing a list of user stories. Although the format of a user story is very straightforward having
a tool like this would boost productivity during both the planning and development stages of an application.

User Story Boilerplate:
as **someone**
I want to **do something**
so that I can **achieve something**

There are of course multiple formats which you could account for in your application as a bonus feature.
